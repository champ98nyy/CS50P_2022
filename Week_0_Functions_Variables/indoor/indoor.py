# Indoor Voice

"""
In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs
that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. Youâ€™re welcome, but not required,
to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.
"""

# Prompt user for input
x = input("What would you like me to translate into an indoor voice? ")

# Print user input in all lowercase letter
print(x.lower())
