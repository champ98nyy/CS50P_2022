"""
It’s not uncommon, in English, at least, to say “um” when trying to, um, think of a word. The more you do it, though, the more noticeable it tends to be!

In a file called um.py, implement a function called count that expects a line of text as input as a str and returns, as an int, the number of times that
“um” appears in that text, case-insensitively, as a word unto itself, not as a substring of some other word. For instance, given text like hello, um, world,
the function should return 1. Given text like yummy, though, the function should return 0.

Structure um.py as follows, wherein you’re welcome to modify main and/or implement other functions as you see fit, but you may not import any other libraries.
You’re welcome, but not required, to use re and/or sys.


import re
import sys


def main():
    print(count(input("Text: ")))


def count(s):
    ...


...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


Either before or after you implement count in um.py, additionally implement, in a file called test_um.py, three or more functions
that collectively test your implementation of count thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_ so that you can execute your tests with:

pytest test_um.py
"""


import re

# Main function passes text string input by user prompt to count() function, and prints the returned total quantity of the word "um"
def main():
    print(count(input("Text: ")))

# Custom function uses RegEx to check user input for the word, "um" then returns the total quantity of occurences
def count(s):
    qty = re.findall(r'\bum\b', s, re.IGNORECASE)
    return len(qty)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
