# Just setting up my twttr

"""
When texting or tweeting, itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter was originally called twttr.
In a file called twttr.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a str of text and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted,
whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.

# Create a list of vowels to use for checking if each letter in the tweet is a vowel
vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]

# Request user input of a Tweet, remove leading/trailing spaces and assign value to tweet variable
tweet = input("Input: ").strip()

# Split the tweet into a list of words and assign value to words variable
words = tweet.split()

# Create an empty list called final
# Loop through each word in the list of words and create a list of characters for each word, assigning the value to the letters variable
final = []
for word in words:
    letters = list(word)

    # Create an empty list called new_letters
    # Start a nested loop iterating over each letter in the list of letters for the current word in the list of words
    new_letters = []
    for letter in letters:

        # If the current letter is a vowel, set the temp_letter variable equal to an empty string, otherwise set the temp_letter variable equal to the current letter
        if letter.lower() in vowels:
            temp_letter = ""
        else:
            temp_letter = letter

        # Add the temp_letter to the list of new_letters (if it was a vowel, it will add an empty string which will be eliminated in next step)
        new_letters.append(temp_letter)

    # After checking all letters in the word, use the join method on the list of new_letters to create the final word (without any vowels)
    final_word = ''.join(new_letters)

   # Add the final word to the final list
    final.append(final_word)
    print(final_word)

# Once all vowel-less words are added to the list, use the join method with a space to create the final string output of the tweet
