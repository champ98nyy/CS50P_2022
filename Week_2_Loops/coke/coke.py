"""
Suppose that a machine sells bottles of Coca-Cola (Coke) for 50 cents and only accepts coins in these denominations: 25 cents, 10 cents, and 5 cents.

In a file called coke.py, implement a program that prompts the user to insert a coin, one at a time, each time informing the user of the amount due.
Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, output how many cents in change the user is owed. Assume that the user will only input integers, and ignore
any integer that isnâ€™t an accepted denomination.

    # Continue the below process as long as there is a balance due for the Coke
    # Request user to input the value of a coin
    # If user correctly inputs values (25, 10 or 5), call the transaction function to re-calculate the balance. Otherwise, re-prompt the user for input
    # After each coin is inserted, notify the user what the new balance is
